# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

- Measure tool: toggle from the panel (or press `M`), then click two points
  to measure the distance between them (total, Δx, Δy). `Escape` clears the
  current measurement.

## [1.0.0]

Initial release.

- Custom editor for `.gds` (GDSII layout) files that parses and renders the
  layout in a WebGL2 canvas.
- GDS parsing and rendering run in a C++/WebAssembly module (gdstk) for fast
  loading of large layouts, with parsing off the main thread.
- Handles SREF/AREF (including array references), rotation, mirroring, and
  magnification via gdstk's flattening.
- Pan (drag) and zoom (scroll) navigation, with a Reset View action to refit
  the layout to the window.
- Per-layer visibility toggles.
- Infill toggle to show or hide the hatched layer fill.
- Optional KLayout `.lyp` file loading to drive layer colors.
- "GDSLens: Toggle Debug Tools" command to show/hide the render stats readout
  and debug log.
